# Mafia-TheTerminalGame

Note: 
Most AsCII art was sourced from all over the internet and I don't remember where I found each art work. 
Feel free to download and modify the game in any way you want. 


INSTRUCTIONS:
1) GO to your Terminal/Pycharm/Any IDE Terminal and install curses with this comand "pip install windows-curses"
2) Open the main_game.py file OR type "python main_game.py" on the IDE's terminal
3) Once the window pops up, maximize it (full screen). If you don't do that the game will crush.


Things You Should Know ABOUT THE GAME - (Based on wikipedia)

* In mafia, there are 2 teams: the mafia and the townspeople. The mafia try to eliminate the townspeople while the townspeople try to guess who’s in the mafia.
* Each mafia game includes a detective and a doctor. The detective can guess a mafia member each turn while the doctor can save a townsperson each turn.
* Mafia is played in night cycles and day cycles. In night cycles, mafia members eliminate (or “kill”) townspeople while everyone’s eyes are closed.
* In day cycles, players accuse and eliminate people they think might be a part of the mafia. Accused players are allowed to give defenses and a vote takes place.
